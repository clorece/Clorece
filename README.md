## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a rising senior majoring in Computer Science with a focus on AI, Robotics, and Game Development. Through hands-on coursework, personal projects, and active participation in extracurriculars, Iâ€™ve gained experience in team coordination, community engagement, and continuous professional growth. I specialize in game development using GameMaker and Godot, and Iâ€™m proficient in C, Python, Java, and currently learning OpenGL GLSL. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my skill set to stay ahead in a fast-evolving field. I'm excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and contribute to impactful, cutting-edge projects.

I have a growing passion in Graphics Development and have started my journey small using Graphics Development Pipelines like IRIS that is tailored to develop Shaders for the popular video game, Minecraft.

I am currently focused on the development of my Minecraft shader, Allium!
